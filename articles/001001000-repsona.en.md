## Human-centered work management

We develop and continually improve Repsona with a people-centered concept: making work more enjoyable.

To keep the team aligned, clarify the project’s purpose, goals, and concept—and keep them visible at all times. With Repsona, you can always check them on the project home screen.

You can clarify the team structure and visualize who is responsible for what—and who can do what—on the Teammates screen.

Fill out your profile, too. Reactions are collected on the profile screen, where you can see skills and growth.
