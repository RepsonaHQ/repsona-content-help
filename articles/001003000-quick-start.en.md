For those who are new to Repsona and project management. Repsona is very easy to use. Introducing an easy usage guide.

You may have been surprised by the many menus when you first opened Repsona. But don't be afraid! At first, you only need to use the "Task list"!

Repsona is simple, easy to understand, and designed to be easy for anyone to use. Let's start with the basics.

## How to work with Repsona

1. Create a task
2. Assign a person
3. Execute the task
4. When you're done, "Done"!

That's it!

## Create a task

You can create a task from the task list > + button.

Enter a title and create a task. The trick to giving a task name is to use the imperative mood.

Write the details under the task name. Let's clarify what should be done to "finish" this task.

Click the "Create" button to create a task.

## Assign a person

When you have a task, assign a "responsible person". This person is responsible for performing this task.

If the "due date" has been decided, enter it. "Ball" stands for "the person who has the ball temporarily". It is okay if you leave it blank at first or set the same one as the "responsible person".

## Execute the task

The person responsible for execution should move the assigned task forward. You may want to temporarily pass someone to proceed. In that case, set it to "ball" and contact them.

You can contact them in the comments section at the bottom of the task screen. Mention their username in the comments and your teammates will be notified.

Communicate and move your tasks forward step by step.

## When you're done, "Done"!

Have you finished the task? What should I do to "finish" this task? Check the details of the task, and when you're done, change the "Status" to "Done" and you're done.

## Congratulations! The first task is complete!

Even the work that seems to be big and endless can be completed small one by one by dividing it and setting a due date. Even for a large project where you can't see the goal at first, divide it into smaller pieces and make a plan.

It doesn't matter if it's difficult to split. At first, make a rough and big "to-do list", and if you divide the "to-do" little by little, it will grow into a detailed plan.

We hope your project will be fun and smooth!
