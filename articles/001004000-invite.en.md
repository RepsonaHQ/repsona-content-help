Repsona is also useful for managing your own tasks, but more useful with your team. It has useful features such as commenting on tasks and managing their status. Invite your teammates to the space to move your work forward.

## When teammates join

When your teammates join, the space owner will receive an email. Teammates participate with "member" privileges, so change the privileges as needed.

If you invite without setting "Project you want to invite", newly joined members will not be participating in any project. Add it to your project to work with you.
