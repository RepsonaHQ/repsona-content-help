From the project menu, you can open Project home, Task list, Gantt, Status, Assignee, Ball, Priority, Notes, Milestones, Teams, Charts, Productivity, Kaizen, and Settings.

### House icon

Opens the project home. The project home provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, product image, and the latest activity.

### Task list

Opens the task list. It shows tasks in your project with columns for task name, assignee, ball, status, due date, and milestone. You can reorder tasks by drag-and-drop and change the hierarchy.

### Gantt

Opens the Gantt chart. The vertical axis shows the task list and the horizontal axis shows the timeline. This is useful for planning which tasks need to be completed by when.

### Status

Opens the Status view. Status reflects a task’s state such as "In progress", "Confirming", and "Done". Move tasks like cards to manage status on a Kanban board.

### Responsible

Opens the Responsible view. The assignee is responsible for guiding a task to completion. Move tasks like cards to manage who is responsible on a Kanban board.

### Ball

Opens the Ball view. A "ball" is the person temporarily holding a task to move it forward. Move tasks like cards to manage ball holders on a Kanban board.

### Priority

Opens the Priority view. Move tasks like cards to change and manage task priority on a Kanban board.

### Notes

Opens Notes. Notes are where you capture information, documents, know‑how, and runbooks needed to move the project forward. Create structured documents in Markdown. You can arrange notes in a flexible hierarchy by drag-and-drop.

### Milestones

Opens Milestones. Milestones are checkpoints on your schedule. By grouping tasks due by a specific milestone and setting a due date, it becomes easier to check progress.

### Teams

Opens the Teams screen. Teammates are the members who move this project forward. Visualize all members and team composition in the project community. Clarify "Position" and "Strengths or expectations" so the whole project shares an understanding.

### Charts

Opens Charts. You can view cumulative flow, tag breakdown, and burndown charts.

### Productivity

Opens the Productivity screen. It turns member activity into a score and displays charts.

### Kaizen

Opens the Kaizen screen. Kaizen provides a KPT board (Kanban format) for team retrospectives. Visualize team problems and link them to tasks to work toward solutions.

### Settings

Opens project settings. Configure the project profile, project members, and more.
