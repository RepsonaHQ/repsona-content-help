## What is a Gantt chart?

![Gantt chart](/images/help/timeline.svg)

The Gantt chart is a list of tasks on the vertical axis and a period on the horizontal axis, and is an easy-to-understand representation of the entire time plan from the start to the end of the project.

You can get a panoramic view of the tasks of the entire project, and at a glance you can see information such as the order in which tasks are to be carried out, due dates, and responsible persons.

With Repsona, you can easily create the following Gantt charts with just a click or drag-and-drop.

## How to make a Gantt chart

Click "Gantt" from the "Project Menu".

![Project Menu](/images/help/project-menu.en.png)

### Make a task list

First, list the tasks you want to manage in your project. Identify all tasks that you know at the time of planning. You can also use parent-child relationships to make the display easier to understand.

### Set start / end (draw bar)

<img src="/images/help/gantt-bar.png" width="181">

To the right of the task is a date-separated area. Clicking on this part will bring up a "bar" where you can set the due date for the task. The bar can be moved, stretched and shrunk by drag-and-drop. The color of the bar is automatically determined by the color of the responsible user. The user's color can be changed in the user settings.

### Adjust period, due date, bias (adjust bar)

Draw a bar for every task you need and adjust the start and end positions. Make sure you have enough time, aren't focused on a particular due date, and aren't biased towards a particular person.

### Tips for making Gantt charts

#### Bias adjustment

Using the "responsible" grouping makes it easier to see the bias of tasks towards a particular responsible person. In a real project, it's rare that you're always working during the time the line is drawn. In other words, it cannot always be said that "lines overlap = busy". By discussing with the project managers and project members and drawing lines while recognizing them, you will have a convincing schedule.

#### First perfection

You can't make a perfect plan from the beginning. It is recommended that the first edition be completed when you say, "I wonder if it's something like this." What you really need to spend time on is not planning, but executing.

#### The plan is a creature

When you make a plan, you may get the illusion that you are going according to plan, or you may get caught up in the idea that you have to go according to plan. But plans are creatures. It is important to notice outside the plan and take countermeasures, and to constantly review and reflect on the plan. Let's grow the plan.

## How to use the Gantt chart

### Check the progress of the task

The dark part in the bar shows the progress rate of the task (the rate at which the status is nearing completion).

### Check task details

Click the task name or bar to display the task details sidebar. You can change the person responsible for the task, change its status, add comments, and more.

### Create and search tasks

You can create and search tasks in the same way as the "Task List" screen.

### Set the display period

Click the button with "Display start date - Display end date" to display a calendar in which you can select the period. If you set the period on the calendar, you can set the display period of the Gantt chart. Click the cross button to reset to the default period. You can lock the display period with the lock button.

### Move to "today" location

Clicking the "Today" button will move the side-scrolling position of the Gantt chart to today's location.

### Display in units of "day", "week", and "month"

Click the "Day", "Week", and "Month" buttons to display the Gantt chart in units of each period.

### Display in units of "List", "Responsible", "Ball", and "Milestone"

Click the "Responsible", "Ball", and "Milestone" buttons to group and display the Gantt chart in each unit. "List" is displayed without grouping.

### Display information such as task name in the bar

Click the "i" button to display the task title, status, and due date to the right of the bar.

### Lock Gantt chart edits

Click the padlock button to lock the Gantt chart edits (only affects yourself). The default is locked.

### Display in due date order

Click the due date sort button to sort the tasks in the Gantt chart by due date. Since the parent-child relationship is maintained during sorting, subtasks are sorted within the due date of the parent task.

### Display progress lines

Press the lightning line button to display progress lines.

### Move task bars together

Press the move together button to be able to move task bars together. Tasks with parent-child relationships or dependencies will move together. Also, if you hold down Shift and select multiple tasks, the selected tasks can be moved together at the same time.

### "Undo" "Redo"

By pressing the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons, you can return to the previous state or redo it.

### Add milestones

You can add milestones by clicking the "Add Milestone" button and entering the milestone name and due date.

On the Milestone screen, set and group the tasks you want to complete by that milestone.

### Adjust the area width of the Gantt chart

The line between the task list part and the date part can be adjusted by drag-and-drop.

### Scroll the Gantt chart horizontally

You can scroll by using the scroll bar of the window or by dragging the date part.

### xlsx export

You can export xlsx from the task list submenu.

## Set task dependencies

### Make task dependencies

When you hover your mouse over the bar, blue balls will appear on the left and right of the bar.

<img src="/images/help/gantt-bar.png" width="181">

You can create a dependency by drag-and-drop the blue ball onto another task that has a dependency.

If the start of the successor task is set before the completion of the predecessor task, the dependency line will be displayed in red.

### Remove task dependencies

Open the task details screen and open the details menu below where you want to set the responsible person and status.

<img src="/images/help/task-detail-menu.png" width="35">

Since the preceding task and the succeeding task are displayed, delete them with the cross button.

## When is the Gantt chart useful?

Gantt charts are especially useful for looking at the entire project from a "time" perspective. You can visualize the flow from the beginning to the end of a project, how busy it is, task dependencies, and the resulting waits.

Gantt charts are useful when you want to schedule an overall project, or when you have an order or due date for task execution. Make sure you know who has to do what by when, and get the job done!
