Repsona lets you manage task assignees on the Kanban board. This article explains how to use the Assignee view effectively.

In Repsona, the assignee is responsible for guiding the task to completion. They understand the task’s purpose and details, stay on top of its status, and ultimately complete it.

## What is a Kanban board?

A Kanban board has named lanes (rows) where cards are arranged. You can move cards to understand the overall status. In the Responsible view, you create lanes for each assignee and manage tasks by moving them like cards.

You can quickly see how tasks are distributed across assignees.

Repsona automatically creates a Kanban board for each assignee, and you can easily use it with drag-and-drop.

## When is this Kanban board useful?

The Kanban format is useful for reviewing a project’s overall state at a glance. Viewing tasks by assignee makes it easy to see how work is distributed. Watch for tasks concentrating on a specific person.
