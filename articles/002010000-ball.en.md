Repsona lets you manage ball holders for tasks on the Kanban board. This article explains how to use the Ball view effectively.

In Repsona, a “ball” is the person who temporarily has the ball to move a task forward—for example, someone you’ve asked for a reply or a result and are waiting on.

## What is a Kanban board?

![Kanban board](/images/help/kanban.webp)

A Kanban board is a board with named lanes (rows) where cards are arranged. You can move cards to understand the overall status. On the Ball view, you can create lanes for each ball holder and manage tasks while moving them like cards.

You can see at a glance how tasks are distributed across ball holders.

Repsona automatically creates a Kanban board with lanes for each ball holder, and you can easily use it with drag-and-drop.

## When is this Kanban board useful?

The Kanban board format is suitable for looking over a project and understanding its overall state. Viewing ball holders in a Kanban format lets you see at a glance how tasks are distributed. If the ball is concentrated on a particular person, progress may stall or there may be long wait times. Consider sharing the load.
