## What is milestone?

Milestones are checkpoints on your schedule. By grouping tasks that are scheduled to be completed by a specific milestone and setting a due date, it will be easier to check the progress of tasks up to the milestone.

With Repsona, you can manage the following by creating milestones.

### Check the burndown chart

Grouping tasks by due date milestones will automatically generate a burndown chart. This is a chart showing the number of unfinished tasks, and you can see at a glance how many tasks you need to complete at what pace by the milestone due date.

Gray is the ideal line, yellow is the planned line, and blue is the actual line. The yellow feature line is calculated and drawn based on the due date set for each task. The blue actual line shows the number of tasks that have reached Done (completion status) as of that date.

### Check milestones on the Gantt chart

When you create a milestone with a due date, you will see a vertical green line on the Gantt chart. You can visually see the milestone due date on the Gantt chart.

If you click the "Milestone" button that is displayed in units of "List", "Resp", and "Milestone", the Gantt chart will be displayed in a grouped form for each milestone, and you can check the plan for each milestone.

### Carry tasks within a milestone to the next milestone

Click the "Carry Forward" button to carry over unfinished tasks to the next milestone.
