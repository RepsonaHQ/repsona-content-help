## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a "notation for writing sentences". You can easily write in text, decorate characters such as bold and italics, and structure documents with headings.

It's just text (plain text), so you can easily start writing as if you were leaving a note without any decoration or structuring. You can concentrate on the original work of "writing" without "I don't know how to use the app and it takes time to adjust paragraphs and positions".

In fact, this help site is also created with Markdown.

## Features of Markdown

- Everyone can write easily
- Read as it is
- You can decorate and structure beautifully with a little ingenuity.
- Used in various services
- Since it is text, the difference is easy to understand

## Example of how to write Markdown

For example, if you write a list in Markdown as follows,

```text
- List 1 
- List 2
- List 3
```
It will be automatically converted to HTML and displayed as below.

---
- List 1
- List 2
- List 3

## If you find Markdown difficult, just write it in text

Repsona's note editor supports Markdown, but it's just a text editor (Notepad). Feel free to write a text.

Too much attention to the layout and decoration of the text makes it difficult to get around to the "contents" that should be described in detail. Simply focus on writing the text and put off the layout and decoration.
