## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a "notation for writing sentences" that allows you to easily write in text, decorate characters such as bold and italics, and structure documents with headings.

It's just text (plain text), so you can easily start writing as if you were leaving a note without any decoration or structuring. You can concentrate on the original work of "writing" without "I don't know how to use the app and it takes time to adjust paragraphs and positions".

In fact, this help site is also created with Markdown.

## Features of Markdown

- Everyone can write easily
- Read as it is
- You can decorate and structure beautifully with a little ingenuity.
- Used in various services
- Since it is text, the difference is easy to understand

## How to write Markdown

### Heading

Use `#` for the heading. Increasing the number of `#` will result in a deeper hierarchy of headings.

```
# Heading h1
## Heading h2
### Heading h3
#### Heading h4
##### Heading h5
###### Heading h6
```

<b-card>
<h1>Heading h1</h1>
<h2>Heading h2</h2>
<h3>Heading h3</h3>
<h4>Heading h4</h4>
<h5>Heading h5</h5>
<h6>Heading h6</h6>
</b-card>

### Bold

Enclose it in `**` to make it bold.

```
** Emphasis (bold) **
```

<b-card>**Emphasis (bold)**</b-card>

### Italic

Enclose it in `*` to make it italic.

```
*Emphasis (italic)*
```

<b-card>*Emphasis (italic)*</b-card>


### Strikethrough

If you enclose it in `~~`, it will be a strikethrough.

```
~~strikethrough~~
```

<b-card>~~strikethrough~~</b-card>


### Link

Links can be written as `[link string] (URL)`.

```
[Repsona website](https://repsona.com)
```

<b-card>[Repsona website](https://repsona.com)</b-card>


### List

Use `-` for the list. You can start a new line and make a list continuously. You can move down the hierarchy with tabs.

```
- List
- List
	- List
```

<b-card>

- List
- List
	- List
</b-card>

### Numbered list

Use `1.` for numbered lists. You can start a new line and make a list continuously. You can move down the hierarchy with tabs.

```
1. List
1. List
	1. List
```

<b-card>

1. List

	1. List
</b-card>

### Checklist

Use `[ ]` for the checklist. To check it, use `[x]`.

```
 [ ] Checklist
 [x] Checklist
```

<b-card>
<input type="checkbox" disabled> Checklist<br>
<input type="checkbox" checked disabled> Checklist  
</b-card>

### Table

Write the table by enclosing it like a table using `|` or `-`.

```
| Left align       |       Right align |    Center align    |
|:-----------------|------------------:|:------------------:|
| This             |              This |        This        |
| column           |            column |       column       |
| will             |              will |        will        |
| be               |                be |         be         |
| left             |             right |       center       |
| aligned          |           aligned |      aligned       |
```
