## What Is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a simple text-based markup language that lets you write using plain text while easily adding formatting such as *bold*, *italics*, and headings.

Because it’s just plain text, you can start writing immediately—no complex formatting or software required. It lets you focus on the essence of “writing,” without getting distracted by adjusting layouts or figuring out how an app works.

In fact, this help site itself is written in Markdown.

## Features of Markdown

- Easy for anyone to write  
- Readable as plain text  
- Simple syntax for clean formatting and structure  
- Supported by many platforms and services  
- Since it’s plain text, changes and differences are easy to track

## How to write Markdown

### Heading

Use `#` for the heading. Increasing the number of `#` will result in a deeper hierarchy of headings.

```
# Heading h1
## Heading h2
### Heading h3
#### Heading h4
##### Heading h5
###### Heading h6
```

<b-card>
<h1>Heading h1</h1>
<h2>Heading h2</h2>
<h3>Heading h3</h3>
<h4>Heading h4</h4>
<h5>Heading h5</h5>
<h6>Heading h6</h6>
</b-card>

### Bold

Enclose it in `**` to make it bold.

```
** Emphasis (bold) **
```

<b-card>**Emphasis (bold)**</b-card>

### Italic

Enclose it in `*` to make it italic.

```
*Emphasis (italic)*
```

<b-card>*Emphasis (italic)*</b-card>


### Strikethrough

If you enclose it in `~~`, it will be a strikethrough.

```
~~strikethrough~~
```

<b-card>~~strikethrough~~</b-card>


### Link

Links can be written as `[link string] (URL)`.

```
[Repsona website](https://repsona.com)
```

<b-card>[Repsona website](https://repsona.com)</b-card>


### List

Use `-` for the list. You can start a new line and make a list continuously. You can move down the hierarchy with tabs.

```
- List
- List
	- List
```

<b-card>

- List
- List
	- List
</b-card>

### Numbered list

Use `1.` for numbered lists. You can start a new line and make a list continuously. You can move down the hierarchy with tabs.

```
1. List
1. List
	1. List
```

<b-card>

1. List
1. List
	1. List
</b-card>

### Checklist

Use `[ ]` for the checklist. To check it, use `[x]`.

```
 [ ] Checklist
 [x] Checklist
```

<b-card>
<input type="checkbox" disabled> Checklist<br>
<input type="checkbox" checked disabled> Checklist  
</b-card>

### Table

Write the table by enclosing it like a table using `|` or `-`.

```
| Left align       |       Right align |    Center align    |
|:-----------------|------------------:|:------------------:|
| This             |              This |        This        |
| column           |            column |       column       |
| will             |              will |        will        |
| be               |                be |         be         |
| left             |             right |       center       |
| aligned          |           aligned |      aligned       |
```

<b-card>

| Left align       |       Right align |    Center align    |
|:-----------------|------------------:|:------------------:|
| This             |              This |        This        |
| column           |            column |       column       |
| will             |              will |        will        |
| be               |                be |         be         |
| left             |             right |       center       |
| aligned          |           aligned |      aligned       |
