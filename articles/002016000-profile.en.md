## Profile screen

When you are invited to the Repsona space (or create the space first) and your account is created, you are joining the Repsona space as a teammate (member).

### View my profile screen

Open the setting menu from the icon on the upper right of the screen.<br><img src="/images/help/menu-button.png" width="222">

You can open your profile screen by clicking on your "Name" at the top of this, or on the home screen or in the comments section. The latest activity and main tasks are displayed.

The name, profile image, background image, self-introduction, etc. set in User Settings> User Information are displayed. Please enrich it in case your teammates see your profile screen. To help them understand who you are and what you are doing.

Skill tags such as "programming" and "design", messages such as "thank you" and "sorry", pictograms, and other skills of the person and sent messages are collected. So you can see at a glance what role they play in team activities and how they communicate.

## How to use profile

Repsona is continuously being upgraded as a human-centered project management tool. We are developing a system for managing people, setting goals, and evaluating them, centered on the profile screen.
