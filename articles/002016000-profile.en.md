## Profile screen

When you’re invited to a Repsona space (or create one) and your account is created, you join that space as a teammate (member).

### View my profile screen

Open the settings menu from the icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.<br><img src="/images/help/menu-button.png" width="222">

Open your profile by clicking your name at the top, on the home screen, or in the comments section. Your latest activity and main tasks are displayed.

Your name, profile image, background image, and introduction (set in User Settings > User Information) are shown. Fill these out so teammates can understand who you are and what you’re working on.

### View a member’s profile

Click a member’s name (e.g., in the comments) to open their profile. Their latest activity and main tasks are displayed.

Write an "Introduction from teammates" to introduce this member to others.

### Reactions

The reactions sent in the comment section etc. will be gathered on the person's profile screen.

Skill tags such as "programming" and "design", messages such as "thank you" and "sorry", pictograms, and other skills of the person and sent messages are collected. So you can see at a glance what role they play in team activities and how they communicate.

## Set up a profile

Click "Settings" on your profile to go to User Settings > User Profile, where you can set or change your profile.

### Status
