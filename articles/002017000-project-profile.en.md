### React

You can react to the project at the project home. Express the type of project with tags, or express your gratitude with pictograms.

### Status

#### Today's Todo

Tasks that members participating in the project have set as "Today" are displayed. "Today" is automatically removed the next day, so it's useful for listing what you should focus on today.
