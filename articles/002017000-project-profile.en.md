## Project profile screen

After creating a project, you can display the project home (project profile screen) with the "Home" button on the far left.

The contents set in the project settings are displayed on this screen.

## Set a project profile

You can move to the project settings screen from the "Settings" button on the project profile screen.

Set it so newcomers and stakeholders can understand the project at a glanceâ€”and so long-time teammates stay motivated.

*"Settings" requires Owner or Admin privileges.*

### React

You can react to the project on the project home. Use tags to express the type of project, or show appreciation with emoji.

### Status

#### Today's Todo

Tasks that members participating in the project have set as "Today" are displayed. "Today" is automatically removed the next day, so it's useful for listing what you should focus on today. For example, when team members confirm what they are going to do today at a morning meeting, setting "Today" in advance makes the confirmation simpler.

#### Completed tasks

Completed tasks by this member are displayed. It's useful for checking recently completed tasks.

#### Tasks with Activity

Tasks that have been moved by the activities of members participating in the project are displayed. You can specify the period of movement. It's useful for reviewing the specified period.

#### Upcoming Schedule

The future schedule of members participating in the project is displayed. Only tasks whose specified period is the scheduled working period are displayed. It's useful to specify a period and check what should be done during that period.

### Profile

#### Activity

Activities related to members participating in the project are displayed. When you comment or update a task, the activity is displayed here.

#### Purpose

Articulate the purpose of this project. Please describe the "important reason why we are here" so that new members who join the project can understand the purpose of this project, and so that project members can be excited.

#### Product concept image

Set an image so that project members and new members who join the project can see at a glance what this project is like, what the project looks like, and what its purpose is.
