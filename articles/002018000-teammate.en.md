## Teammates screen

Click "Teams" in the project menu.

### Positions and strengths or expectations

Click the + button to add a "position." Enter the position name and the teammate’s strengths or expectations. You can then set that position for a teammate. Clarifying positions helps teammates reaffirm their responsibilities and helps new members know who to contact and how.

### Project community

This represents everyone involved in the project. If someone isn’t listed here, create a "no-login" member and add them to the project to include them in the project community. (You can also assign them as an assignee or ball holder.)

If the project community includes groups such as companies, organizations, or teams, click the + button below to add a "Team" and give it a name. (From the second one onward, use the "Add team" button above.) You can sort items by drag-and-drop, and create nested teams.

Drag-and-drop members from the project community into teams, and assign them a "position." Build a team structure (org chart) that’s easy to understand at a glance.
