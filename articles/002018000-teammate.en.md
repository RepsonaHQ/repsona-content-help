### Position / Strengths and/or expectations

You can add a "position" with the + button. Enter the name of the position and "Strengths and/or expectations" to create it. The created position can be set as a teammate. By clarifying their positions, they themselves reaffirm their responsibilities. It also helps new members of the team know who and how to communicate.

### Project community

It represents all the characters that surround the entire project. If there is a member not listed here, you can make it visible to the project community by creating a member as "no-login" and joining it to the project. (You will also be able to set the person in charge and the ball)

If you have a group such as a company, organization or team in the project community, add "Team" from the + button below and give it a name. (The second and subsequent ones are the "Add team" button above.) You can also sort by drag-and-drop or create a team within the team.

Drag-and-drop members of the project community into your team to give your teammates a "position". Create a team structure (organization diagram) that is easy to understand at a glance.
