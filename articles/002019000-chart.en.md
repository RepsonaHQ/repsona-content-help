Repsona currently provides three types of charts:

### Cumulative flow chart

Shows a stacked chart of task statuses across the project. You can see at a glance how many tasks are not started, in progress, and completed.

### Tag breakdown

Shows the proportion of tags in your project. For example, if you tag tasks with department or category, you can quickly see whether work is skewed toward a particular tag.

### Burndown chart

Shows how many unfinished tasks remain and the pace required to reach the milestone due date.

Gray is the ideal line, yellow is the planned line, and blue is the actual line. The planned line is calculated from due dates set on tasks. The actual line shows the number of tasks that have reached Done (completion status) by each date.

### Other charts

We plan to add more charts to help visualize team productivity. Repsona is continuously improving.
