The number that members themselves have changed to completion status.

### Done tasks (responsible)

The member assigned the responsibility as the execution manager reports the work completed to the team leader of the project team, and if the team leader changes the status of the task to completed, the score will be added here.

### Done tasks (involved)

The number of times the member has completed a task with the ball at least once. For example, a member who has been temporarily assigned a ball as a worker will be scored here when the task's status is complete, assuming that the work has been completed and the ball has been returned.

## About the score

Repsona's productivity score is calculated simply. If there is no movement, no charge or ball is received, no contribution to the note, or no original productive activity, the number will not increase. Therefore, it can be said that the amount of activity of members with flat charts is small.

On the other hand, in actual work, it may not be evaluated if there is a lot of activity. For example, there are a lot of reactions, a lot of comments, and so on, there are some parts where it is not possible to tell from the chart alone whether or not they have advanced their work.

Members who are in a position to evaluate by looking at productivity and score should comprehensively evaluate not only the numerical value of the score but also the activity content and the positive reaction received.

Repsona is continuously being upgraded as a people-centric work management tool. We will deeply consider these evaluation mechanisms and plan additional development so that you can use them more conveniently.
