Repsona believes that retrospectives are important for team activities. As a retrospective framework, a Kanban board based on the KPT method is prepared by default. This section explains how to use the Kaizen screen.

### What is the KPT method?

The initials of Keep, Problem, and Try are called the KPT method.

- Keep doing what was good (Keep)
- Find a problem (Problem)
- Try to improve the problem (Try)

### What is Kaizen and retrospective at Repsona?

Repsona recommends that you continue to "retrospectives" your team, which is simple and easy, rather than following the correct KPT method. Improve your team's problems by continuing simple and easy-to-understand activities.

## Retrospective

When the project is over, you will look back on the entire project activities and summarize the good points and reflection points. There are quite a few words you wanted to know and problems you wanted to hear before the project was over.

Repsona recommends, for example, a weekly or monthly review. On the premise that there is always a problem in the daily activities of the team, we will visualize the problem, link it with the task, and work toward the solution. That is necessary for healthy team activities.

Also, after looking back, the "good points" of the project will be gathered. Please visualize these good points and "Keep" as the good points of the project team. You should be able to contribute to the excitement of your teammates by displaying good points every day.

## How to proceed with Kaizen

### How to do Kaizen

You can create a "problem" from the + button.

For example, "Our team is not lively," "This office is cold," "My article production is taking too long," and so on. Feel free to discuss "problems" in all genres of the company, the organization, the team, the individual, and the project.

You don't have to think about huge problems. Let's start small with trivial things and questions. You don't have to think about solutions or alternatives from the beginning. It is important to be free to do what you think is the problem.

### "Try" by associating a task with a problem

Try to improve the problem. The important thing here is to clarify the "action" to resolve the problem. In other words, it is a "task". You can select a task from the pull-down menu in Kaizen's "Problem" card. You can also create a new task.

Create actions to identify the problem as "tasks", clarify responsibilities and due date, and move forward. Move the "Problem" card to the Try lane.

### "Keep" the problems solved and the good points of the team

You have completed all the tasks associated with the "problem" and the problem has been resolved. On the contrary, the problem will take root in the team as a good habit. You can give a "name" to the resolved problem. Continue as a good habit for your team.

## Some problems cannot be solved and some problems must be accepted

There is no such thing as no problems in the day-to-day activities of the team. It makes sense to take action on the problems you find and work to improve them.

However, if you find a problem, you may never be able to solve it. Please decide how to deal with such problems and "accept" them.

By not pretending to be invisible or pretending to be solved, but by visualizing it as a clear problem and then "Keeping" it, awareness of the problem within the team and cohesion to face it will be strengthened.
