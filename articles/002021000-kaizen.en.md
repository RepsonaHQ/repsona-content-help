Repsona values retrospectives for healthy team activity. As a simple framework, we provide a Kanban board based on the KPT method by default. This page explains how to use the Kaizen screen.

### What is the KPT method?

KPT stands for Keep, Problem, and Try:

- Keep: continue what worked well
- Problem: identify issues
- Try: experiment with improvements

### Kaizen and retrospectives in Repsona

Rather than strictly following a framework, Repsona recommends lightweight, continuous retrospectives. Keep it simple and easy to sustain so you can steadily improve team issues.

## Retrospective

At the end of a project, review the whole effort: summarize what went well and what didn’t. Ideally, you surface questions and issues before a project ends, too.

We recommend weekly or monthly reviews. Assume there are always opportunities for improvement in day‑to‑day work: visualize issues, link them to tasks, and work toward solutions.

Also capture the team’s “good points.” Visualize and Keep them so everyone can see strengths regularly—it helps morale and alignment.

## How to proceed with Kaizen

### Create a Problem

Click the + button to add a “Problem.”

Examples: “Our team isn’t lively,” “The office is cold,” “Article production takes too long.” Feel free to propose problems at any level—company, organization, team, individual, or project.

You don’t need to start with big problems. Start small. You also don’t need solutions right away—the key is to capture what feels like a problem.

### Try: link tasks to problems

Define concrete actions to resolve the problem—i.e., tasks. On a Problem card, select an existing task from the dropdown, or create a new one.

Assign responsibility and a due date to the tasks, then move the Problem card to the Try lane.

### Keep: solved problems and team strengths

Once all tasks linked to a Problem are complete and the issue is resolved—or a good habit has taken hold—you can give it a name and Keep it as a team practice.

## Some problems can’t be solved—and that’s okay

Not every issue has a fix. Decide how to handle such problems and accept them when necessary.

By acknowledging issues openly rather than ignoring them—and by visualizing them as Problems you Keep—the team’s awareness and cohesion improve.
