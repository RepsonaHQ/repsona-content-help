Repsona included a social-style post feature called “What’s happening?” on the home screen. This page explains how it worked.

## “What’s happening?”

Go to the home screen from the leftmost icon in the main menu.

You could post from the text field labeled “What’s happening?”.

Posts appeared in the home feed of members in the same project. When you mentioned someone, they were notified.

## How it was used

It was intended for lightweight communication not tied to a specific project or task—quick chats among project members, questions and answers, and small comments.
