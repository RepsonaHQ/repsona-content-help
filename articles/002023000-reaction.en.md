You can use emoji ( 👍 😄 😇 😍 🎉 ❤️ ) and tags for reactions.

For gratitude, use tags like "Thank you" or "Thanks!" For skill recognition, use tags such as "Design", "Python", or "Genius". When you need help or clarification, use tags like "Tell me" or "Question". Use any tag that fits the situation.

Reactions are collected on each member’s profile. Over time, they reflect what teammates appreciate and recognize—skills, contributions, and more—so you can get a feel for your teammates at a glance.
