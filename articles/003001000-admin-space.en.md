2. Click "Administrator Settings".
3. Open the "Space profile" tab.

### Space name (URL)

You can set the space name (URL). The `xxx` in `xxx.repsona.com` must be 3â€“30 characters, using lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens ("-"). You can change it at any time.

If you change the URL, the old URL will no longer be accessible and all members will be logged out. Be sure to notify members of the change.

### Full name (official name)

Set the official name of the space. Enter the name of the organization or company the project team belongs to.

### Space language

Set the primary language used in the space. It affects system notifications, invitation emails, and other space-wide messages.

### Information

Display announcements to members who use Repsona in this space. Use this for internal notices.

### Delete your space

You can delete the space. Once deleted, this action cannot be undone. You will lose access to all data in the space. Spaces cannot be deleted if there is an active paid plan.
