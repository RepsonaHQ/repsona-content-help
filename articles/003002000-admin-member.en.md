## Manage space members

1. Open the settings menu from the icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.<br><img src="/images/help/menu-button.png" width="222">
2. Click "Administrator Settings".
3. Open the Members tab.

### Invite new members

1. Click the "Invite new member" button.
1. Enter the member’s email address and username, choose the project to invite them to, then click the "Invite" button.

Members invited to the space will receive an email with a link to join Repsona. They can set a password and log in.

You can also share an invitation link to invite members to the space.

### Create a no-login member

1. Click the "Invite new member" button.
1. Enter the username and other details.
1. Uncheck "Allow login".
1. Click the "Create" button.

By adding a member who cannot log in to a project, you can still assign an assignee or a ball to that member.

For example, create an external partner (outside your team) or a business contact as a "no-login" member. By including that member in the project, you can identify who has the ball during your work interactions.

### Set role

*Owner only*

You can set and change member privileges. Choose from "Owner", "Admin", "Member", and "no-login". If an owner changes another member to "Owner", they immediately switch to "Admin" and lose owner privileges.

### Set billing status

You can set and change the billing status. Choose from "Active" and "Inactive". On paid plans, there is a charge per active member. Inactive members are not counted as active.

### Inviting members

A submenu appears to the right of invited members and no-login members who don’t have an email address set.

#### Set an email address and invite

If you want to change the email address of an invited member and re-invite them, set the new email address and click the "Send invitation email" button.

If you set the email address for a no-login member and click the "Send invitation email" button, you can invite them to the space as a member who can log in.

#### Change information

You can change the username and full name of the invited member. Information for members who have already joined the space can only be changed by that member.

#### Revoke invitation

Revoke the invitation. This operation is irreversible.
