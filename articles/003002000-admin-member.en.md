### Invite new members

1. Click the "Invite new member" button.
1. Enter the email address and user name of the member you want to invite, the project you want to invite, and click the "Invite" button.

Members invited to the space will receive an email with a link to join Repsona. The user can set a password to log in.

You can also share the invitation link to invite members to the space.

### Create a no-login member

1. Click the "Invite new member" button.
1. Enter the user name etc.ã€‚
1. Uncheck "Allow login"
1. Click the "Create" button.

By joining a member who cannot log in to the project, you will be able to assign a person in charge or a ball to this member.

For example, create an external partner other than your teammates or a business communication partner as "no-login". You can identify who has the ball in your work interaction by having that member participate in the project.

### Set role

*Owner only*

You can set and change the privileges of members. You can select from "Owner", "Admin", "Member", and "no-login". If the owner changes a member other than them to the owner, they will immediately switch to "Admin" and lose the owner authority.

### Set billing status

You can set and change the billing status. You can select from "Active" and "Inactive". With the paid plan, there is a charge per active member. Inactive members are not counted as active.

### Inviting members

A submenu is displayed to the right of the inviting members and the no-login members whose email addresses have not been set.

You can change the user name and full name of the invited member. The information of the members who have joined the space can be changed only for each member.
