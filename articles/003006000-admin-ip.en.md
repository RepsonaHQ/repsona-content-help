2. Click "Administrator Settings".
3. Open the Allowed IPs tab.

### Current IP address

The connection source IP address currently connected. Add the current IP address to the allowed IPs for space IP restrictions to take effect. You can add it with the "Add" button.

### Enable IP restrictions on spaces

Turn on the Enable IP restrictions on the space switch and click the Save button to enable IP restrictions on space. When you enable IP restrictions on a space, you will immediately be unable to access the space from anyone other than the allowed IP address.

### Add an allowed IP address

To add an IP address that allows connection, click the "Add Allowed IP Address" button. Enter the allowed IP address and memo (optional), and click the "Save" button.

Connections from allowed IP addresses are allowed even with IP restrictions enabled.

### Disable IP restrictions on spaces

If you turn off the Enable IP restrictions on the space switch and click the Save button, the IP restrictions on space will be disabled. You will be able to access from all IP addresses.

### Even if IP restrictions are disabled, you cannot log in without an account

Even if the IP restrictions are disabled and you can access from all IP addresses, you cannot log in without an account to log in to the space. The URL to log in is also different for each space, so people who do not know the URL cannot access it.

### If IP restriction is enabled, access from the mobile communication network will not be possible.

When IP restriction is enabled, only access from a specific IP address is allowed. Since the IP address of the mobile communication network is not fixed, it cannot be used in addition to the permitted IP.
