2. Click "Administrator Settings".
3. Open the "Billing" tab.

### Current plan

Shows your current plan: Free or Standard.

If you're on the Free plan, the "Upgrade to Standard" button appears.

If you're on the Standard plan, the time and amount of your next payment are shown. You can change plans from the "Change plan" button.

### Payment method

Paid plans currently accept credit cards. Add the credit card you want to use for payment.

### Change credit card

Enter your new card information and click the "Add card" button. The card is added to the list. Click "Use this card" for the new card.

### Company name and address

Set your company name and address information. This information appears on invoices.

### Payment history

View your payment history. You can download invoices and receipts from the invoice number link. Only the most recent 24 months are displayed.

### Switch to Free plan

If you have an active paid plan, you'll see a "Switch to Free plan" button. Your current plan remains active until it expires; when the billing period ends, you'll move to the Free plan.
Because the Free plan allows only one project, select which project to keep when switching.
