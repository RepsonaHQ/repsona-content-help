1. Click "Settings" on the right side of the project menu.
2. Open the "Project profile" tab.

### Set the full name (official name)

Enter the "Full name (official name)" and click "Save". Choose a name that people can understand at a glance.

What is this team doing? What is this project about? Give the project a clear name such as "XX Development Project", "Team XX Task Management", or "XX Production Committee".

### Set the project name

### Set the purpose of the project

Enter the "Project purpose" and click "Save". It appears on the project home. State the "important reason why we are here" so new members immediately understand the purpose and current members stay motivated.

The project profile image appears throughout Repsona.

### Set the background image

Click "Change your background" and upload an image. You can also drag and drop. Adjust the size and position, then click "OK".
