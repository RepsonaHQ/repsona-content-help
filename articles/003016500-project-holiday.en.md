### Regular holidays

Set the day of the week that will be a holiday each week.

### Holidays

Set when there are periods other than days of the week when the entire project is closed, such as national vacations or special periodic vacations.

### What happens if I set a holiday?

If nothing is set, Saturday and Sunday are set as holidays. If you set up individual holidays or weekends, the corresponding period in the calendar or Gantt chart in Repsona will be grayed out and reminder e-mails will not be sent.
