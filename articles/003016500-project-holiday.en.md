![Project holiday settings](/images/help/space-holiday.en.png)

### Regular days off

Set the days of the week that are days off every week.

### Holidays

Set periods other than weekly days off when the entire project is closed, such as national holidays or special scheduled breaks.

### What happens when I set holidays?

If nothing is set, Saturday and Sunday are treated as days off. When you set specific holidays or weekends, the corresponding periods in Repsonaâ€™s calendar and Gantt chart are grayed out, and reminder emails are not sent.
