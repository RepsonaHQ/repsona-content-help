### About Slack notifications

If a Slack account uses the same email address as a user in Repsona, they’ll be mentioned in Slack as well. All selected events will trigger notifications. We recommend setting the linked Slack channel’s notifications to "Mentions only".

## Delete the Slack integration

Click the "Del" button in the list on the "Slack integration" screen.
