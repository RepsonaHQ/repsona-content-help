Frequently asked questions and answers about Repsona.

## Billing

### Can I upgrade Repsona alone, not everyone in the space?

Unfortunately it is not possible. Repsona was developed with the goal of facilitating collaboration within the team, so paid plans are also built on that assumption. To upgrade Repsona, you need to upgrade the space itself.

### What payment methods can I use?

Only credit card payment is supported.

### Repsona credit points are given to the space. How to use this?

When the space is subscribed to a paid plan, the usage fee will be deducted from the credit point until the credit point is used up, and the credit card will be charged when the remaining point becomes zero. Credit points can be used indefinitely if you change to a paid plan before the credit points expire.

### I need to add a new user to the space. What will happen to new users?

Your new credit card will be charged to your credit card separately from your regular payment for the remaining days of your current billing period. For example, suppose you use the “Standard Plan” in a certain space, and the price is $ 7.5 per month for active users (monthly payment). Suppose a member is added on the 10th day of the billing period, and 20 days remain until the start of the next billing period. The daily cost for each user is “$ 7.5 ÷ 30 days”, so a separate charge of $ 5.0 ($ 7.5 ÷ 30 days × 20 days) will be incurred on the credit card in the registered space.

### I want to cancel the space contract. How to cancel Can I get a refund?

Space owners can change the space contract level. When you downgrade from a paid plan to a free plan, you will automatically downgrade to a free plan on the next renewal date. Your current contract is valid until the end of the billing period that you have already paid. I'm very sorry, but refund is not supported.

### What is an activity log?

"Activity log retention period" is an action log that says "task created" or "commented". It is not the retention period of "data" such as tasks and notes. Tasks and notes will not disappear after the activity log retention period expires.
