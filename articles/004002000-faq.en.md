FAQ

## Pricing and payment

### Can I upgrade only myself, not all members in my space?

Sorry, upgrades apply to the entire space. Repsona is designed to help teams collaborate smoothly, and our paid plans follow that purpose. To use the advanced features, please upgrade your space.

### What payment methods are accepted?

Currently, we accept credit cards only.

### How can I use Repsona credit points?

If you have Repsona credit points, they will be applied first. Your credit card will not be charged until your points are used up. Your points will not expire as long as you sign a contract before their stated expiration date.

### I want to invite a new member to the space. How will you charge for the new member?

The fee for the new member is prorated based on the days remaining in the current billing period and will be charged to your credit card in addition to your regular payments.

For example, if a new member is added on the 10th day of the billing period and there are 20 days left until the next billing period, under the following conditions:
- Your contract: Standard plan
- Fee per member: $8.00 per month per active user

The daily fee for the new member is "$8.00 divided by 30 days", and the total cost will be $5.33 (20 days Ã— daily fee). This will be charged to the registered credit card for the space where the member was added.

### I want to use the Free plan. How can I cancel? Can I receive a refund?

Only a space owner can change the contract. If the owner downgrades from a paid plan to the Free plan, it will automatically switch on the next renewal date. Your contract remains valid until the end of the current paid period. We do not provide refunds for fees already paid.

### What is the activity log and its retention period?

The activity log records messages such as "A new task was created" or "Commented on your task". The retention policy applies only to activity messages. Tasks and notes are not deleted when the activity log reaches its retention limit.
