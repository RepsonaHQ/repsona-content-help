If you’re having trouble connecting to Repsona—or pages and tasks aren’t updating—see this page.

## Check system requirements

Make sure you’re using a supported OS and browser, and the latest version of Repsona. If you’re using an unsupported or older browser, you may experience connectivity issues and some features may not work.

## Network settings

Repsona uses WebSockets over port 443 to maintain a persistent connection between the Repsona server and member apps and browsers.

Proxies and firewalls can block this connection. If necessary, adjust your settings to allow persistent connections to Repsona.

## Network environment

Antivirus software, ad‑blocking software, security tools, and firewalls can interfere with Repsona’s connection.

Temporarily disabling such software can help troubleshoot connectivity issues. If this resolves the issue, configure the software to allow Repsona.

If the connection issue persists, contact your organization’s network administrator. If you need further assistance, feel free to contact Repsona Support.
